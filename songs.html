        <p>I lost you in a waiting room</br>
        After sleepin' there for a week or two</br>
        Doctor said he did all he could</br>
        You were the last thing I had that was good</br>
        So I walked miles on the Tulsa streets</br>
        Light started beamin' in from the east</p><footer>Zach Bryan</footer>

        <p>Golden haze</br>
        Another morning feels like yesterday</br>
        End of may</br>
        A year is gone</br>
        And I still feel this way</br>
        When we meet again</br>
        I'll ask you how you're doing</br>
        And you'll say, "Fine" and ask me how I'm doing</br>
        And then I'll lie and I'll say, "Ordinary</br>
        It's just an ordinary day"</p><footer>Tim Seely</footer>

        <p>_________</p>

        <p>So, I'll drive all night to nowhere</br>
        Just to chase the sun</br>
        I said the battle's almost over</br>
        But, my god, which side has won?

        <p>_________</p>

        <p> Just like an old friend</br>
        Kinder than expected</br>
        That Cadillac came and gave our girl a ride</br>
        Loss has no end</br>
        It binds to our connection</br>
        And we don't speak of it, we don't even try</p><footer>Mandolin Orange</footer>

        <p>_________</p>

        <p>Have you seen her dressed in blue?</br>
        See the sky in front of you</br>
        And her face is like a sail</br>
        Speck of white so fair and pale</br>
        Have you seen a lady fairer?</p><footer>The Rolling Stones</footer>
