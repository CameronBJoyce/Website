        <h3>Forgetfulness</h3>
        <h4>Billy Collins</h4>
        <p>The name of the author is the first to go
followed obediently by the title, the plot,</p>
<p>the heartbreaking conclusion, the entire novel
which suddenly becomes one you have never read, never even heard of,</p>

<p>as if, one by one, the memories you used to harbor
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain,
to a little fishing village where there are no phones.</p>

<p>Long ago you kissed the names of the nine muses goodbye
and watched the quadratic equation pack its bag,
and even now as you memorize the order of the planets,</p>

<p>something else is slipping away, a state flower perhaps,
the address of an uncle, the capital of Paraguay.</p>

<p>Whatever it is you are struggling to remember,
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue
or even lurking in some obscure corner of your spleen.</p>

<p>It has floated away down a dark mythological river
whose name begins with an L as far as you can recall</p>

<p>well on your own way to oblivion where you will join those
who have even forgotten how to swim and how to ride a bicycle.</p>

<p>No wonder you rise in the middle of the night
to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war.</p>
<p>No wonder the moon in the window seems to have drifted   
out of a love poem that you used to know by heart.</p>
