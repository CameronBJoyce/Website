<ul><p>Big changes for me over the past year. Celebrated 3 years with Avery in February, graduated from Wofford College this past May, moved to Reston, Virginia, and started a new job at Booz Allen Hamilton.</br></br>I absolutely adore our new apartment. It is 800 sq feet and the rent is crazy, but it is ours and I love to call it home. Has been strange telling people that I now live in Reston as it seems like a foreign place still at the moment.</br></br>We started going to church at a local Episcopal church here and have met some wonderful people in the congregation. I am starting as a volunteer beekeeper with them soon as well.</br></br> <a href="l.html"  style="color:purple;" target="_blank">Click me to hear about Lavender</a></p></ul>
