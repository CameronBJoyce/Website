        <section id="aboutme">
            <p>Founded by a machine learning and automation engineer, Fide Capital Management was created on the principles of ultra-low-cost management, transparency, automation, and research-backed methodologies.</p>
            <p>__________</p>
            
            <h3>Fee structure</h3>
            <p>__________</p>
            <p>What separates FCM is our fee structure. The primary feature is “No Salt in the Wound" Guarantee where I don’t take any money in years your portfolio is in the red except for compliance costs (~$50). I do better when you have more money, so I don’t compound losses by taking more away from you when the market is down.</p>
            <p>The fee that I do charge you in green years is capped at $4000 and if you hold less than $400,000 with me, your fee will always be less than $4000. Therefore, as it grows beyond $400,000, your AUM rate decreases for you every year and will approach zero. When you have 1 million dollars, your AUM rate is .004. When you have 2 million, it is halved to .002.</p>
            <p>My costs are minimal, I don’t have an office of full-time staff you are paying for (I do have a part-time lawyer and an auditor), I do minimal marketing, I programmed this website myself, and this isn’t even my full-time job.</p>

            <p>__________</p>
            <h3>Transparency</h3>
            <p>__________</p>
            <p>Every trade and every decision is backed by research. Not “research” from some 22-year-old Goldman analyst who is making $230,000 a year off of you, but from peer-reviewed academic literature. The funds I pick are low-cost, diversified, and aren’t financial products that have nasty traps a lot of financial advisors use that have front-loading (fees on the way in and on the way out) or other fees designed to siphon money from your pocket to theirs without you even realizing it. I largely use Vanguard or Avantis funds and only select the lowest-cost funds from those famously low-cost companies.</p>
            <p>You worked hard for your money. Let’s get it working hard for you, not printing checks for me.</p>

        
            <p>__________</p>
            <h3>Automation</h3>
            <p>__________</p>
<p>Some financial service practitioners are technology averse. I am not. I automate, monitor, build anomaly detection models, and streamline everything using code I wrote (free, once again) to get costs down and your returns up. I orchestrate the flow of your money to where forecasting future returns and explainability are always at the forefront.</p>

<p>You will receive quarterly updates, but I encourage all of my clients to take a long-term view of their investments.</p>

            <p>__________</p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>__________</p>
    <p><b>Asset Allocation Research:</b> I invest in low-cost, diversified, and global funds that track common industry benchmarks. I also have a slight weighting towards research-proven factors such as small-cap value (small companies with a low P/E ratio) for people whose situation this makes sense for (mostly early-mid accumulation stage investors). I invest your money right along with my money in the same way and have your interests aligned with mine.</p>

<p><b>Solving the problem of financial advisors (me):</b> A lot of the problems in financial advisory services we see are derived from the principle agent problem (a conflict that arises between an individual or group (you) and the individual (me) charged with representing them, due to agency costs, whereby the agent avoids responsibilities, makes poor decisions, or otherwise engages in actions that work against the benefit of the individual they represent), and asymmetric information (I know something you don’t know). The industry claims it has solved this by implementing fiduciary responsibilities, but it is a difficult problem to solve and many advisors exploit the “gray area” on this topic. </br></br>The main way we can solve the principle agent problem is to put in place the right incentives that ensure agents do not act in their interests. I have capped my fees at an industry-wide low rate and don’t take money in years that you lose it (I have an incentive to make you money every year and when I don’t, you just got this year for free). The main way we solve the problem of asymmetric information is that I never use jargon, I am crystal clear about the fees and expense ratios, and point to every decision I make as being backed by research as the best information we have available to us. </p>
