    <p>Welcome to Sad Trombone, the Chrome extension you never knew you needed until you clicked on a link, heard a womp-womp noise, and felt oddly seen.</p>

    <p>Iâ€™m Sad Trombone, a deeply unserious human who wrote some incredibly serious JavaScript so you can experience tiny, glorious moments of disappointmentâ€¦ set to the soundtrack of failure.</p>

    <p>This extension is for anyone whoâ€™s ever opened Facebook and immediately regretted it. For those who read the comments on a news article. For brave souls who checked their bank account on a Monday. Sad Trombone plays a soul-crushing, horn-based wah-wah sound on websites you choose, reminding you gentlyâ€”yet sonicallyâ€”that life is a parade of micro-defeats.</p>

    <h2>Why does it exist?</h2>
    <p>Because not every browser interaction deserves dignity. Some deserve to be heckled by a sad brass instrument.</p>

    <p>If it makes you laugh, cry, or question your life choices in a productive way, consider supporting the madness. 
       <a href="https://buymeacoffee.com/sadtrombone" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Buy me a coffee</a>. 
       Or a trombone. Or just validate my existence with a click.
    </p>

    <p>ðŸŽµ Womp womp forever.</p>

    <p>â€” Sad Trombone</p>
